 *1. Observables don’t start executing until they’re subscribed. This makes Observables handy whenever an action is required.
 *2. Error handling is the responsibility of Angular Observables. When we utilize Observables,

 * 3.The RxJS Observables library is a powerful tool.
 * 4.Observable in Angular is a feature that provides support for delivering messages between different parts of your single-page application.
 *  This feature is frequently used in Angular because it is responsible for handling multiple values, asynchronous programming in Javascript, and also event handling processes.
